        Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence. Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", or “the ability to learn
        and solve problems” hence Artificial Intelligence means "a man-made thinking power."

        Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. Knowledge is the
information acquired through experience. Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure (training).
Summing the terms up, we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural (i.e., human
beings)‘WHO’ is capable of acquiring and applying the information it has gained
through exposure.”

        Artificial Intelligence exists when a machine can have human-based skills such as learning,
reasoning, and solving problems with Artificial Intelligence you do not need to preprogram a machine to
do some work, despite that you can create a machine with programmed algorithms which can work with
own intelligence.

        An AI system is composed of an agent and its environment. An agent (e.g., human or robot) is
anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through
effectors. Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them. In classical planning problems, the
agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the
consequences of its actions. However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can
reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that cannot only assess its environment and make
predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment. Machine perception is the
ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, sensors, etc.) to deduce aspects of the
world. e.g., Computer Vision.

        High-profile examples of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as drones and self-driving cars),
medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as
Chess or Go), search engines (such as Google search), online assistants (such as Siri), image recognition in
photographs, spam filtering, prediction of judicial decisions and targeting online advertisements
AI deals with the area of developing computing systems that are capable of performing tasks that
humans are very good at, for example recognizing objects, recognizing and making sense of
speech, and decision making in a constrained environment.

        The advent of Big Data, driven by the arrival of the internet, smart mobile and social media has
enabled AI algorithms, in particular from Machine Learning and Deep Learning, to leverage Big Data and
perform their tasks more optimally. This combined with cheaper and more powerful hardware such as
Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) has enabled AI to evolve into more complex architectures. Machine
Learning is an advanced form of AI where the machine can learn as it goes rather than having every action
programmed by humans.

        Many times, students get confused between Machine
Learning and Artificial Intelligence (see figure 3.1), but
Machine learning, a fundamental concept of AI research since
the field’s inception, is the study of computer algorithms that
improve automatically through experience. The term
machine learning was introduced by Arthur Samuel in 1959.
Neural networks are biologically inspired networks that
extract features from the data in a hierarchical fashion. The
field of neural networks with several hidden layers is called
deep learning.
