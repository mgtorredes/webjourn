        <h1>Emerging Technology</h1>
    </header>

    <article>
        <p>Emerging technology is a term generally used to describe a new technology, but it may also refers to the continuing development of existing  technology; 
            it can have slightly different areas, such as media, business, science, or education.</p>
        <p>The term commonly refers to technologies that are currently developing, or that are expected to be 
            available within the next five to ten years, and is usually reserved for technologies that are creating or are 
            expected to create significant social or economic effects. Technological evolution is a theory of radical 
            transformation of society through technological development.</p>

        <h2>Evolution of technologies: Introduction to Industrial revolution</h2>
        <p>The Industrial Revolution was a period of major industrialization and innovation that took place 
            during the late 1700s and early 1800s.</p>
        <p>An Industrial Revolution at its core occurs when a society shifts from 
            using tools to make products to use new sources of energy, such as coal, to power machines in factories. 
            The revolution started in England, with a series of innovations to make labor more efficient and productive. 
            The Industrial Revolution was a time when the manufacturing of goods moved from small shops and homes 
            to large factories. This shift brought about changes in culture as people moved from rural areas to big cities 
            in order to work.</p>
        <p>The American Industrial Revolution commonly referred to as the Second Industrial Revolution, 
            started sometime between 1820 and 1870. The impact of changing the way items was manufactured had a 
            wide reach. Industries such as textile manufacturing, mining, glass making, and agriculture all had 
            undergone changes. For example, prior to the Industrial Revolution, textiles were primarily made of wool 
            and were handspun.</p>
        <p>From the first industrial revolution (mechanization through water and steam power) to the mass 
            production and assembly lines using electricity in the second, the fourth industrial revolution will take what 
            was started in the third with the adoption of computers and automation and enhance it with smart and 
            autonomous systems fueled by data and machine learning. 
            Generally, the following industrial revolutions fundamentally changed and transfer the world 
            around us into modern society. </p>
        <ul>

            <li>The age of science and mass production, and</li>
            <li>The rise of digital technology</li>
            <li>Smart and autonomous systems fueled by data and machine learning.</li>

        <h1>Historical Background</h1>
        <p>The industrial revolution began in Great Britain in the late 1770s before spreading to the rest of Europe. 
           First countries after England that was industrialized were Belgium, France, and the Germanic States. 
           Its final cause was the effect of Agricultural Revolution.</p>
            <p>The four types of induestries are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Primary Industry which involves raw materials.</li>
            <li>Secondary Industry which involves manufacturing.</li>
            <li>Tertiary Industry which provides services.</li>
            <li>Quartenary Industry which involves research and development industries.</li>
        </ul>
       <p><b>Industrial Revolution (IR 1.0)</b></p>
       <p>It is described as a transition to new manufacturing process.
          It was first coined in 1760s.
          It was also the first transition from hand production methods to machine, 
          the increasing use of steam power, and the development of machine tools and rise of the factory system.
       </p>
       <p><b>Industrial Revolution (IR 2.0)</b></p>
       <p>It is also known as the Technological Revolution, began somewhere in the 1870s. 
          The advancements includes the development of of methods for manufacturing interchangeable parts and widespread of adoption of pre-existing technological systems such as telegraphs and railroads network.
          This enhanced the vast communication.
          This revolution also introduced electrical powers.
       </p>
       <p><b>Industrial Revolution (IR 3.0)</b></p>
       <p>This introduced the transition from mechanical and analog electronic to digital electronics which began from 1950s.
          This was given the nickname, "Digital Revolution"
          Its core factor was the mass production and widespread use of digital logic circuits and its derived technologies such as computers, handphones, and the Internet.
       </p>
       <p><b>Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0)</b></p>
       <p>It is the advancements of various technologies such as robotics, Internet of Things, additive manufacturing and autonomous vehicles.
          The term was first coined by Klaus Schwab in the year 2016.
          The technologies mentioned above are what we call - cyber physical systems. It is a mechanism that is controlled or monitored by computer-based algorithms, tightly integrated with the internet and its users.
          Another major breakthrough is the adoption of Artificial Intelligence.
