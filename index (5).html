            The most important features of IoT include artificial intelligence, connectivity, sensors, active
engagement, and small device use. A brief review of these features is given below −
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>AI</b> - IoT essentially makes virtually anything “smart”, meaning it enhances every aspect of life
with the power of data collection, artificial intelligence algorithms, and networks. This can mean something
as simple as enhancing your refrigerator and cabinets to detect when milk and your favorite cereal run low,
and to then place an order with your preferred grocer.

           <b>Connectivity</b> − New enabling technologies for networking and specifically IoT networking, mean
networks are no longer exclusively tied to major providers. Networks can exist on a much smaller and
cheaper scale while still being practical. IoT creates these small networks between its system devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Sensors</b> - IoT loses its distinction without sensors. They act as defining instruments that
            transform IoT from a standard passive network of devices into an active system capable of real-world
            integration.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Active Engagement</b> - − Much of today's interaction with connected technology happens through
            passive engagement. IoT introduces a new paradigm for active content, product, or service engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Small Devices</b>- − Devices, as predicted, have become smaller, cheaper, and more powerful over
            time. IoT exploits purpose-built small devices to deliver its precision, scalability, and versatility.
