        <h1>Technology and Ethics</h1>

            The boom of the Internet has provided many benefits for society, allowing the creation of new tools and new ways for people to interact.
            The Internet, just like other technologies, has not without negative aspects, like the concern of privacy, spam, and viruses. 
            It also serves as a medium of communication across the globe.

            Technology can promote or restrict human rights.
             The <em><b>Information Society</b></em> should foster the use of emerging technologies in such  a way as to maximize the benefits that they provide with less harms.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em><b>Ethics</b></em> is particularly important for the accountancy profession, with a code for professional ethicsbased on five basic principles - integrity, objectivity,  competence, and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.
            However, the emergence of new technologiesraises some new challenges for the profession to address.

            The increasing use of big data, algorithmic decision-making, and artificial intelligence can enable
more consistent, evidence-based and accurate judgments or decisions, often more quickly and efficiently.
However, these strengths can potentially have a darker side too, throwing up questions around the ethical
use of these fairly new technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, outputs can be based on biased data, which could lead to discriminatory outcomes.
Indeed, where systems learn from real-world data, there is a significant risk that those systems simply
recreate the past and subsequently build in errors or systemic biases. Closely linked to discrimination is
personalization, and the impact of tailoring decisions very specifically to individuals, based on preferences,
activities and other features. While this can be beneficial for many, others can lose out, and outcomes can
again seem unfair or unethical.
        </p>
        <p>
Additionally, questions are being asked regarding the interaction between computers and humans.
How much reliance can we place on data and models, and what is the role of human judgment, as well as
how do we ensure that we understand the decision-making process? Whatever the power of the machine,
humans will still need to be involved, so that people can be held accountable, or explain the reasons behind
a decision.
        </p>
        <p>
A central problem of the ethics of technology is that it tends to arrive too late. In many cases, ethical
issues are only recognized when the technology is already on the market and problems arise during its
widespread use. Ethics can then become a tool to clean up a mess that might have been avoidable. It is
probably not contentious to say it would be desirable to have ethical input at the earlier stages of technology
design and development.
        </p>
        <p>
Indeed, there are ethical theories and approaches that explicitly aim at an early integration of ethics
into the technology life cycle. One central problem of this type of approach is that the future is unknown.
By definition, we do not know with certainty what will happen in the future and ethics that relies on future
development needs to be able to answer the question of how it decides which technological developments
to pursue. Ethics has traditionally not been well equipped to deal with issues of uncertainty and, in
particular, future uncertainty.
